Task Management App, how it works: 

1.) Add your task by name, category, date and status and then click add task and refresh to see your task
2.) You can delete your task with the delete button that automtically populates when you create a task
3.) Filter by status, category filter feature not available at the moment only "all" option is available as categories are based on user preference 

Reflection:
Biggest challenges in this project: I struggled with the filtering and dropdowns and adding a delete button immensely. Those features were extremely hard to write.
How I solved it: I create a wireframe and pseudo code to try to make this easier. I spent a lot of time Googling around for specific parts of the code that I was not sure how to write.
I had to move some code that was originally separate into the render function, specifically the delete button and status drop down. That managed to get it to work properly.
What I would improve: I would probably add a duplicate prevention feature, more styling and more error handling. I would try to write cleaner and easier to read code, 
but I really did try to, but I had limited time to do this.
